# CaseSolution
Hello. While solving this case, I used C# asp.NET.Core MVC,EntityFramework technologies.Besides, I made visual edits using HTML-CSS and Javascript.
The reason I use MVC as the main technology here is because it brings a very practical solution to the problem I need to solve.
To solve the problems we encounter in the most effective and shortest way and what technology, framework, etc. I think it is more convenient to use.
I made the CRUD operations of the project in the StudentController.cs class in the Controllers section.
I coded the visual parts and buttons in the Index section of the Student file.
I used EntityFramework Packages to connect to the database and it made our job a lot easier.
In my Startup.cs class, I implemented the swagger package that I used for API request operations.
The project certainly has its shortcomings. With your help, I can see and correct these errors and omissions.
But since I wrote the database in my local, you may not have an output.If there is a database, it will work when you connect it directly to your local.
